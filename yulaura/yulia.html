    Caramel Fleur De Sel

    <h2>
    Many reasons to start the sweet life

    <p>Ever since I saw Ina Garten make homemade fleur de sel caramels awhile back, I’ve been itching to give them a try myself.  I have to admit that candy thermometers still make me nervous (always get so anxious waiting for candies to reach the right temperature!!), but these looked too good to resist!!  And after conquering the homemade caramel sauce for this amazing buttercream earlier this year, I figured I could wait just a little longer for them to reach the “firm ball” stage for this recipe.  :-)
    So I dug out my candy thermometer, picked up an extra carton of heavy cream (somehow I always forget what’s behind the “creamy-ness” in caramel!), and decided to give these a go on my lunch break this week.  And I’m pleased to report….
    …<b>SUCCESS!!!</b>

      Well, there was one fatality with my candy thermometer.  After making it through the process, it accidentally got bumped and shattered in the sink.  Oops.  But the caramel was a total, and utterly delicious success.  Again, I felt like the cooking part of it felt like a project in science class — watching (while not stirring) the caramel go from clear, to faint yellow, to “golden brown”.  And then, as Ina says, watching the mixture boil up “violently” as the cream is added in.  But overall, it really wasn’t that difficult!  I took the extra step of making “rolled” caramels like Ina, but next time will probably just do simple cubes.  (They get wrapped up anyway!)
      So if you love caramel, and even if you’re not the best of friends with your candy thermometer, I completely recommend giving these a try!  Especially with that yummy fleur de sel, these truly are a huge step up from anything you can purchase in the store.  Classy.  Cute.  Delicious.
