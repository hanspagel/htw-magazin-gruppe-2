              On Monday evening, the Culinary Historians of New York gathered on Manhattan’s
              Upper East Side to discuss the political and economic underpinnings of
              ramen-noodle soup. “Next month’s meeting is called Dethroning the Deceitful
              Pork Chop, ” a member named Linda Pelaccio reminded the audience of about
              fifty students, foodies, and septuagenarians from the podium. “But now,
              Professor George Solt!”

                Solt, an assistant history professor at New York University, had been
                hunched over his notes in the first row. He is thirty-five, with
                close-cropped hair and a slightly Snoopy-ish air about him. He rose and
                took in the room; many in attendance were slurping quietly from small
                bowls of ramen provided by the Harlem restaurant Jin Ramen. Solt chose
                to open with a caveat: “First off, I don’t know how to cook ramen or
                where to get the best ramen,” he said. “I’m approaching this from a
                historical perspective.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Twelve years ago, Solt, who spent the first decade of his life in Tokyo,
                before moving to New England, began researching his dissertation at the
                University of California, San Diego. Entitled “Taking Ramen Seriously:
                Food, Labor, and Everyday Life in Modern Japan,” it delved into the food
                production, labor practices, foreign trade, and national identity wrapped
                up in Japan’s now famous noodle soup. He has published other noodle-related
                academic writings, including an article in the International Journal of
                Asia-Pacific Studies, “Shifting Perceptions of Instant Ramen in Japan
                during the High-Growth Era, 1958-1973.” But his most accessible piece
                of work on the topic is a book borne of his doctoral dissertation, “The
                Untold History of Ramen: How Political Crisis in Japan Spawned a Global
                Food Craze,” which was published in February.

                His talk traced ramen from its origins, as a distinctly Chinese soup
                that arrived in Japan with Chinese tradesmen in the nineteenth century,
                through the American occupation after the war, to the proliferation of
                instant ramen in Japan in the seventies; the national frenzy in the
                eighties and nineties that gave birth to ramen celebrities, ramen
                museums, and ramen video games; and, finally, America’s embrace of
                ramen and Japanese culture today, as exhibited by the cultlike craze
                surrounding the sixteen-dollar bowls of ramen served by the celebrity
                chef David Chang.

            <p>
              “Ramen is one of the most minutely documented foods in Japan,” Solt writes.
              A number of geopolitical and economic factors—the reindustrialization of
              Japan’s workforce during the Cold War, the redefining of national identity
              during twenty years of economic stagnation—all combined to elevate ramen
              from working-class sustenance to a dish that is internationally recognized,
              beloved, and iconic. His research involved reading everything from ramen
              graphic novels to government documents produced during the U.S. occupation.
              In what Solt describes as an “Aha!” moment, he discovered that when the U.S.
              occupied Japan it imported wheat as a way to contain Communism. “The more
              Japan experienced food shortages, the more people would gravitate towards
              the Communist Party,” he said. By providing the wheat needed to make ramen
              noodles...

              The crowd listened, mostly rapt, as Solt showed photos of Japan’s ramen
              museum (not to be confused with its instant-ramen museum), which opened in
              1994 and cost thirty-eight million dollars. “The ‘sun’ sets indoors every
              fifteen minutes because it’s supposed to make you hungry,” Solt said. He
              also showed the first packaged instant Chikin ramen, from Nissin Foods
              Corporation, which hit shelves in 1958. The first Cup O’ Noodles came to
              America in 1973, Solt said, and, as he showed a photo of the hut where
              Nissin’s founder, Momofuku Ando, allegedly invented the dish, he noted,
              with gravity, that Ando’s innovation had to do “both with Styrofoam and
              the fact that more noodles were concentrated at the top, so it cooked
              evenly.” In Japan, the dish was embraced widely as a practical emergency
              food after a live television broadcast of a hostage standoff, seen by
              almost ninety per cent of television viewers, showed policemen eating
              cupped ramen in sub-zero temperatures as they waited for the hostage to
              be released. Bento boxes and onigiri, their usual forms of sustenance,
              would have frozen solid. Instant, cupped ramen, to this day, remains a
              ubiquitous food in times of natural disaster.

              After the talk, Solt opened the floor to questions. One woman wanted to
              better understand the alkalinity of the ramen noodle, and the historical
              and political importance inherent in the noodle itself. Another audience
              member raised her hand. “I’ve heard that someone in Los Angeles, or New
              York, is making a ramen that is curly,” she said. Long beat.
              “Is that O.K.?” Solt nodded thoughtfully, then said, “I think so.” He
              stayed an additional fifteen minutes after the evening officially wound
              down, speaking with a long line of ramen fans.
              Afterward, on the way to the nearby Naruto Ramen, on Third Avenue, Solt
              was aglow. “So many people showed up!” he said, revealing how lonely a
              decade of ramen research can be. Perusing the menu at the crowded bar,
              as woks sizzled and smoked behind the counter, he elaborated on America’s
              love of the dish.

            <p>
              “Sushi became the representative food of Japan in the nineteen-eighties
              abroad, when Japan was a major business competitor to the U.S.,” he said.
              “The whole embrace of Japanese popular culture in the last ten years is
              because Japan is no longer an economic threat. That image got transposed
              to China. It used to be Japan’s burden.”

              Over a bowl of shio (salt) ramen, Solt spoke about moving beyond noodles.
              He’s now researching the first authentic Indian curry in Japan, a dish
              markedly different from the sludge-like, bland curried rice introduced by
              the British Navy during the Meiji era. The spicier version came to Japan
              in the early twentieth century, largely owing to a revolutionary from
              British India, who fled to Japan after trying to kill a British viceroy.
              There, Japanese ultra-nationalists sheltered him as he developed an Indian
              curry recipe in the back kitchen of a Shinjuku bakery.

            “Now, that’s a great story!” Solt said, finishing the last of his ramen.
            “But, actually, I don’t want to keep doing food. After curry, I don’t
            know what else there is. Soba? There’s a limit to how long you can do this
            kind of stuff and take yourself seriously.”
